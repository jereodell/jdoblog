      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to start this way. But it’s where I am. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two and half years after ChatGPT launched and I am just now beginning to sort out what LLMs are for. From my reluctant and limited recent use, it appears that Gen AI in writing and image generation is for the bored. The product it produces is not meant to be read. The images are cringeworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tasks it completes are those that the user was too bored to tackle. Sure, maybe it gets some people off to a start, but even that start is a dull one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have worked in &amp;ldquo;higher&amp;rdquo; education for twenty-five years (with an intervening  seven year break as a caregiver). I have some degree of experience in English Literature, Bioethics, U.S. religion and culture, Wikipedia, and (most of all) academic librarianship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I garden, read, write, run, and commute by bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also have a fondness for plants, animals (including humans), and food.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this site, I do not name or link to my employer. I do not link to my professional profiles. I do not directly discuss my research. In other words, my speech is thus curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
