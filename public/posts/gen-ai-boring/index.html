<p>I have been told that I can ask Gen AI tools to jazz it up. Uh huh.</p>
<p>Gen AI reminds me of web searching. (It is web searching of a kind.) Does anyone that is not living in 1993 still find web searching fun?</p>
<p>Yes, I have also used chatbots to help me code. This too was boring &ndash; and more parts maddening. The troubleshooting worked, to a point. But only after I bounced and read the documentation myself. I guess if I already knew the ins and outs of calling up an API and retrieving results with Python, this boring task would have been a lot faster.</p>
<p>In the context of work, I could see how AI might enable me to do more boring things in less time.</p>
<p>Yay.</p>
<p>In the context of living, I would rather live.</p>
<p>Give me a year and maybe I’ll change my mind.</p>
