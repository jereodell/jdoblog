I have worked in "higher" education for twenty-five years (including a seven year break as a caregiver). I have some degree of experience in English literature, Bioethics, U.S. religion and culture, Wikipedia, and (most of all) academic librarianship.

I garden, read, write, run, and commute by bicycle.

I also have a fondness for plants, animals (including humans), and food.

On this site, I do not name or link to my employer. I do not link to my professional profiles. I do not directly discuss my research. In other words, my speach is thus curtailed.

If you must, I imagine that you will find a way to contact me.
